# Code Comment Standards

## Context

- When writing new code
- When reviewing existing code
- When refactoring or modifying code
- When documenting functions, classes, or modules

## Requirements

- Keep all docstrings that provide API documentation
- Keep comments that explain:
  - Complex algorithms
  - Non-obvious behavior
  - Design decisions and rationale
  - Performance implications
  - Security considerations
- Remove comments that:
  - Simply restate what the code does
  - Label obvious code sections
  - Describe trivial type casting
  - State the obvious
- Use type hints instead of type-related comments
- Place comments on their own line above the code they describe
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

## Examples

✅ Correct:

```python
# Good: Explains complex algorithm
def calculate_neighbors(grid: Grid, pos: Position) -> int:
    # Use sliding window approach for better performance
    # than individual cell access
    return np.sum(grid[pos.y-1:pos.y+2, pos.x-1:pos.x+2]) - grid[pos.y, pos.x]
```

❌ Incorrect:

```python
# Bad: Restates the obvious
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Add a and b together
    return a + b

class User:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize user properties
        self.name = ""  # The user's name
        self.age = 0   # The user's age
```

## CRITICAL

- NEVER keep comments that only restate the code
- ALWAYS explain why, not what, when commenting
- ALWAYS keep docstrings for public APIs
