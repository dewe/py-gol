# Commit Message Standards

## Context
- When committing changes
- 

## Requirements
- If changes are not known, use `git status` and `git diff` to understand the changes.
- Split commits in logical chunks.
- Use git commit message rule for crafting the commit message.
- Do not include newlines `\n` in the git commit command.

## Examples

✅ Correct:
```text
git commit -m "feat: <commit description>"
```

✅ Correct:
```text
git commit -m "feat: <commit description>" \
  -m "<commit body 1>" \
  -m "<commit body 2>"
```

❌ Incorrect: command contains newline characters
```text
git commit -m "feat: <another message>\n\n<commit body>
```

## CRITICAL
- NEVER use newline characters when applying commands
- ALWAYS use multiple `-m` when submitting multiline commit messages
